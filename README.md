# Textile defects detector
Group project for the "Images and signals elaboration" course of BSc in Computer Science implemented in MATLAB to detect textile defects using filters and masks.

Given a folder of images this tool's goal is to detect the defective products and highlight the specific area where the defect occurred.

Our approach consists of selecting (by allowing the user to select a portion of the product) or finding a pattern in each image to create one or a group of masks to analize the whole input and detect the defective areas.

By analyzing a small set of test images we found out that the tool works well in detecting horizontal and vertical defects; however an AI approach could lead to much more accurate results.
